\section*{Exercise 4}

\subsection*{a) - c)}

We continue our analysis of $y_2$ with the noise term. We now take random input sets which are uniformly distributed over the given intervals. The response surface discussed in 3e) contains 16 terms, which means we need at least 16 input samples. This process is repeated for 160, 1600 and 16000 samples. The resulting response surface coefficients are shown in Tables \ref{tab:monty_160} and \ref{tab:monty_16000}. The two-term coefficients are summarized as their standard deviation from $b_{ij} = 0.25$.

We see that the initial response surface does not approximate the function very well. 16 samples does not appear to be sufficient. The subsequent surfaces steadily improve by converging to the expected value.

\subsection*{d)}

Repeating the experiment with different random seeds primarily affects the 16-sample response surface. For the subsequent surfaces, the deviation from the expected value remains similar over experiments.
